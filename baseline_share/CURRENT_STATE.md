## Source layer

- Current known source layer: `docs/matrixlabs/`
- `docs/matrixlabs/` present: `true`
- Current architecture extraction commit: `fb4a0ce1678b0f9e84952b32f5be6937b111df4d`
- Current C8 post-patch surface-decision acceptance commit: `fb4a0ce1678b0f9e84952b32f5be6937b111df4d`

## High-level state

- Architecture extraction source layer exists: `true`
- Post-patch surface decision acceptance exists: `true`
- `baseline_share/` is an uploadable projection, not source of truth.
- No MatrixLabs runtime/probe/build/rerun command was executed by the generator.
- Receipts were not rewritten.
- The full receipt stack was not copied into `baseline_share/`.

## Uncertainty

- Any missing commit value above means the generator could not discover it from git history for the expected paths.
- This packet summarizes source-backed docs where present; missing source docs are treated as uncertainty, not fact.
